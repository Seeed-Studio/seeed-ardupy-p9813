# Seeed ArduPy P9813 [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-p9813.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-p9813)

## Introduction

Grove - Chainable RGB LED is based on P9813 chip which is a full-color LED driver. It provides 3 constant-current drivers as well as modulated output of 256 shades of gray. It communicates with a MCU using 2-wire transmission (Data and Clock). This 2-wire transmission can be used to cascade additional Grove - Chainable RGB LED modules. The built-in clock regeneration enhances the transmission distance. This Grove module is suitable for any colorful LED based projects.

## How to binding with ArduPy
- Install [AIP](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/ardupy-aip)
- Build firmware with Seeed ArduPy P9813
```
    aip install Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-p9813
    aip build
```
- Flash new firmware to you ArduPy board
```
    aip flash <path of the new firmware>
```
For more examples of using AIP, please refer to [AIP](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/ardupy-aip).

## Usage

```
from arduino import grove_chainable_led
import time

rgb_led = grove_chainable_led(0, 1, 1) #clock, data, led_numbers

while True:
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 255, 0, 0) #NO, red, green, blue
    time.sleep(2)
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 0, 255, 0)
    time.sleep(2)
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 0, 0, 255)
    time.sleep(2)
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 0, 255, 255)
    time.sleep(2)
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 255, 0, 255)
    time.sleep(2)
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 255, 255, 0)
    time.sleep(2)
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 255, 255, 255)
    time.sleep(2)
```

## API Reference

- **set_rgb(*No, R, G, B*)**

    Set RGB corresponding to LED No.
    ```
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 255, 0, 0) # Make LED No. 1 red
    ```

- **set_hsb(*No, H, S, B*)**

    Set HSB corresponding to LED No.
    ```
    rgb_led.set_rgb(1, 0.025, 1.0, 0.5)
    ```
